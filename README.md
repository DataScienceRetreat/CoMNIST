## Cyrillic-oriented MNIST

A list of 278x278 png images representing all 33 letters of the [russian alphabet](images/Cyrillic.zip) and the 26 letters of the [latin alphabet](images/Latin.zip).

*The dataset will be regularly extended with more data as the collection progresses*

### Coming up soon!
A web service that reads drawing and identifies the word/letter you have drawn.
Ability to submit an expected word and get back the original image with mismtaches highlighted (for educational purposes)

### Participate
The objective is to gather at least 1000 images of each class, therefore your contribution is more that welcome! One minute of your time is enough, and don't hesitate to ask your friends and family to participate as well.
