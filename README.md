## Cyrillic-oriented MNIST

A list of 278x278 png images representing all 33 russian alphabet letters and the 26 letters of the latin alphabet.

The [images](images/) are split into sub directories:
* Cyrillic only: the 21 letters unique to cyrillic
* Latin only: the 14 letters unique to latin
* Cyrillic and latin: 12 letters that both alphabet have in common (even if their meaning and/or pronounciation is different)

*The full dataset (50,000+ images, at least 1000 for each class) will be made available on May, 1st 2017*

### Coming up soon!
A web service that reads drawing and identify the word/letter you have drawn.
Ability to submit an expected word and get back the original image with mismtaches highlighted (for educational purposes)

### Participate
The objective is to gather 2000 images of each class, therefore your contribution is more that welcome!
